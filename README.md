## Installation
Since Ubuntu is a web-based application, there is no need for installation or setup on your local machine. Simply open a web browser and navigate to the Ubuntu website. <a href = "https://ubuntuapp.herokuapp.com">Ubuntu</a>
<br>
<br>
However to install locally, you will need a local development server e.g XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
<br>
Follow the instructions below to setup locally:
<br>
<br>
1.Download XAMPP: Visit the XAMPP website (https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) and download the appropriate version of XAMPP for your operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux). Follow the installation instructions provided on the website to complete the installation.

2.Start XAMPP: Once XAMPP is installed, start the XAMPP control panel. This panel allows you to start and stop the Apache web server and MySQL database server.

3.Import the Database: Download the Ubuntu database from the provided source (e.g., a SQL dump file). Open the phpMyAdmin tool in XAMPP by clicking on the "Admin" button next to MySQL. In phpMyAdmin, create a new database for Ubuntu. Then, select the newly created database and choose the "Import" tab. Browse for the downloaded database file and import it into the database.

4.Configure Database Connection: Locate the Ubuntu project files on your local machine. Look for a database credential file (app/database/cred.php) within the project's codebase. Open this file in a text editor and update the database connection settings to match your local setup. Update the database host, username, password, and database name to match your XAMPP configuration.

5.Move Project Files: Move the entire Ubuntu project folder to the appropriate directory within your XAMPP installation. For example, for a typical XAMPP installation on Windows, move the project folder to the "htdocs" directory.

6.Start Apache and MySQL: In the XAMPP control panel, start the Apache web server and MySQL database server by clicking the "Start" button next to each. Wait for the status indicators to turn green, indicating that both servers are running.

7.Access Ubuntu Locally: Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost/ or http://localhost/your_project_folder_name if you placed the project in a subfolder within the "htdocs" directory. You should see the Ubuntu web application running locally on your machine.


## Usage

To use the platform:
Open a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).
Type in the URL of the Ubuntu website or click on a provided link.
Once the website loads, you will be presented with a login or signup page.
If you already have an account, enter your login credentials and click "Login." If not, click on the "Sign Up" button to create a new account.
After logging in or signing up, you will be directed to your dashboard, where you can access the various features of Ubuntu.
